= Releasing

This project is released to Maven Central directly using the `maven-release-plugin`.
There is a handy script that automates this process even more, including release on GitHub.

For testing the local setup, process, permissions, etc., it's best to start with a defensive prerelease, manual publishing and manual push of changes to SCM:

[code,shell]
----
./release.sh --release 1.2.4.CR1 --development 1.2.4.Final-SNAPSHOT --prerelease -DautoPublish=false -DpushChanges=false
----

For fully automated and tested process just use:

[code,shell]
----
./release.sh --release 1.2.4.Final --development 1.2.5.Final-SNAPSHOT
----

Happy releasing!
